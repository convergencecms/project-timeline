Project Timeline using Convergence Item Lists
================

We loved the HTML template for online project timelines built by @bradfrost - we thought wouldn't it be cool if we built this on Convergence?

So we did.

A few enhancements:
- Add multiple projects
- Add timeline events easily
- Link to and upload files

See a working demo here:

## Setting up

- Add a new site in Convergence with Item Lists
- Login and under ITEM LISTS add one called "Timeline"
- Add another ITEM LIST called "Timeline Date"
- Edit the Settings for "Timeline Date"
- Add a field called Timeline - use field type: Timeline (Dropdown Menu)
- Add a field called Date
- Add a field called File
- Add a field called File Description - use the field type: Single Line Text Box
- Save your changes.
- Add a new item into "Timeline" and give it your project name
- Add a new item into "Timeline Date" ... maybe called "Initial Contact", choose your project, date, file, and file description
- Repeat this for any other dates on your timeline.
- Voila! You can go back into your "Timeline" item and click "View in Site".
